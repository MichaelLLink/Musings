# Hello, World!

Well, I guess you've got to start somewhere.  If you're reading tihs, you know of me in some way, shape, or form.  Therefore, I'll spare both of us the introduction.

This blog will mainly be a writing pad for me to reflect and share information on any number of the various topics I deal with in my daily life.  However, some things I'll probably definetly touch on over the course of this year.

* Finance
* Stock Market
* Investments
* Computer Science Education
      -AP CS A
      -AP CS P
      -Practical Security
      -My new lecture series: How2Hack
** Practical Security
** My new lecture series: How2Hack
* Teaching
* Disability Studies
* Hacking
* Computer Systems Security
* Ethics
* Faith (and/or Lack Thereof)
* My Side Projects (such as The Unexpected)
* My Book

If any of that intrigues you, stick around.  If not, stick around anyways because I'll post some funny memes every once and a while.
